                  <h4><span class="text_secundary">Circular Motion </span> in Helicopters</h4>
                  <p>
                    A helicopter is a type of aerial transportation, very commonly used. The helicopter is a roadcraft that lifts itself by using horizontal spinning rotors. 
                    The helicopter generates a lift because of the way its blades are formed; they are able to push air downward, getting a resistance by the air resistance, making it go up. 
                    Although the mechanism of how the helicopter generates lift is quite impressive, the topic of focus is circular motion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Helicopters are big boxes of steel and heavy metals that can weigh a lot of tons, that's why the motor located on top of the helicopter needs a tremendous amount of torque force, 
                    and of course when the helicopter is taking off, angular and tangential acceleration occur in the blades. Although there are many helicopters and many different sets of data, 
                    I found out, helicopters can reach 225 revolutions per minute (RPM) or 23rad/s, but this might vary a lot depending on the helicopter. This stays true to almost any method of transportation, 
                    fuel generates torque force, and then a motor or rotor rotates something to create movement; in this case huge blades that move air to the opposite side of where they are moving, in boats they use the same mechanism, 
                    but instead of air, they use water, and cars also use this, but quite differently.Cars generate circular motion, to their wheels, that then using the friction are able to move the car. In cars you can also find different types of fuel sources; as an example you could say gas and electricity 
                    are two of them. In the case of electric cars, they don’t need to produce combustion, instead use the electricity to generate the necessary force; and this is why electric cars generate much more torque than gasoline for example. This is how circular torque and circular motion generate movement in the majority of transport options.

                    <h4><span class="text_primary">Circular Motion </span> in Centrifugues</h4>
                    <p>
                      "The centrifuge arm sits at the base of a high circular chamber, beneath it a massive direct-drive electric motor capable of generating accelerations that – without the anti-g trousers – would cause most normal people to lose consciousness."
                        <br>
                         <br>
                         A centrifuge is a machine that possesses a rapidly rotating container that applies centrifugal force to its contents, It varies what you put in, you can put in fluids from the human body.
                         An object in the tube requires a large centripetal force. When the liquid can’t provide such a large force, the object will move (sink) to the end of the tube, but in this case we would talk about the astronauts This is used for astronauts or 
                         air force pilots. These people are exposed to a huge acceleration. They are put in the centrifuge. They start rotating, to get used and to know how to manage the huge acceleration. Centrifuges can reach 20-G’s, 
                         but people can withstand from 9-10 G’s They are commonly made of steel, iron, and strong metals. How the centrifuge looks and works is the following: is a machine with a motor, or rotor in the middle, with two long arms that rotate at high speeds, just like the one seen in the picture, above.
                         In this case, the center applies the torque force, and austronauts or any subject put in the machine, would rotate incredibly fast, because the arms are very long, they get a big tangential acceleration, and speed, because the radious is longer. These machines are located in NASA's headquarters, or some air-force camps.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        NASA, has a project in development, they want to change the ISS, for a huge centrifuge. This would look like a big circle, so that austronauts, can walk on the edge of this circle feeling 1G. Being in zero gravity give some complications, including
                      health conditions. The physics behind this are amazing, is exactly the same concept as the 0G airplane. It exerts 1G of force upwards to any subject inside of it, the two equal forces cancel out, making its summatory 0. In space they are amming to do the same, 
                      but there is no other force that cancels out the acceleration exert by the centrifuge, making it an earth-like emvironment.

                      <p>In sports you can find a lot of options where to find circular motion; like the concept in sports is so simple, I am going to mention a bunch of sports, the idea or concept is always exactly the same, 
                          we would see a muscle apply torque force, then a part of your body would move in circular motion, either creating a circle or the majority of the time a semi-circle. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                         In tennis for example, each time you want to hit the ball, you do a circular movement, and the axis of rotation would be your shoulder. When you are swimming you also generate torche force with your shoulder, 
                         that's also the axis of rotation, and then your whole arm would create a circular movement. When a golfer wants to strike a hit, it is exactly the same, same muscle, same axis of rotation, same motion, 
                         same part of the body, same is true for someone bowling, or boxing. Other different examples would be a soccer player hitting the ball, in that case the muscle that generates the torque would be the thighs, 
                         and the axis of rotation would be the knee; although this depends on the exercise, if you want to hit a long-shot, your muscle that generates the torque would be your butt, and the axis of rotation would be somewhere close to your hips. 
                         A basketball player bouncing the ball in the floor, would rotate his hand, his forearm would generate torque, and your axis of rotation would be the wrist, you would create circular motion, but once you let go of the ball, 
                         it keeps its tangential velocity, because there is no longer centrifugal force.

                    <p>
                        In this scene our protagonists find themselves in an attraction trying to talk with someone, before they notice, the attraction starts with them inside of it. The attraction works a lot like a centrifuge; and its mechanism is basically the same as the ones we saw in technology. There is a big motor in the center, that gives the torque force, the machine spins, making the high angular acceleration and velocity. Because of their tangential velocity, and the law of inertia, their bodies would want to go flying away in a straight line to the circle (a tangential line, it only touches one part of the circle), but because they have a metal structure behind of them, that acts like the centrifugal force that keeps the circular motion together, and pushes you to the center, they stay in their position.

                    <p>
                        As it is commonly known, Fast & Furious is a famous ongoing saga of very skilled racers; the plot changes every time, but someone with great skills behind the wheel, should know how to drift, and in Fast & Furious they do this a lot
                        <br>
                         <br>
                      Drifting is a beautiful way to represent not only circular motion, but a lot of physics concepts, not only because of how the wheels are arranged in a weird opposite, but not really direction of the movement, 
                      is not just because of how the mechanism of a car works, getting combustion, to generate energy to give the motor that creates the torque force, to make the wheels spin, making angular and tangential motion, 
                      creating car movement using the friction, but how drifting itself works. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Drifting consists on moving the car on a close circle, moving the car perpendicular to how its supposed to be, that's why the wheels are perpendicular to the car’s front, almost making a 90 degree turn compared to their 
                        original position, so they can continue moving, not losing any inertia, or momentum meaning they don’t lose any velocity, so it's a fast way of making a curve. The car passes from a tangential movement and velocity, straight 
                        to an angular movement and velocity, like every circular movement, it has a centrifugal force, in this case the friction. The wheels are are turning in the way the want to go, in the other hand, the side of the wheel, that's 
                        not supposed to spin, is receiving all the momentum, so it doesn’t allow it to break the circle, and this friction with the side of the wheel sometimes generates smoke.

                        Kratos is a fictional character from the franchise of the best selling game God of War. Kratos is a demi-god, and he fights titans, gods and many other types of creatures. 
                        Kratos possesses a variety of weapons, but his most iconic ones are his blades (Blades of Chaos). They are two blades attached to chains so he can have a long distance attack. 
                        He grabs the chains and speans them in circles similar to the movement of a helicopter. If we would examine his body, he would use his shoulders as the source of torque force, 
                        as well as the axis of rotation. He would accelerate his blades with angular acceleration, once he reaches a high angular speed, he would throw the blades to his enemies at 
                        a high tangential speed.

                        <br>
                        Just like Is said in the Tokyo drift example, drifting consists on moving the car on a close circle, moving the car perpendicular to how its supposed to be, that's why the wheels are perpendicular to the car’s front, almost making a 90 degree turn compared to their 
                        original position, so they can continue moving, not losing any inertia, or momentum meaning they don’t lose any velocity, so it's a fast way of making a curve. In this case is exactly the same, in this case is not a very close circle, the didference from this scence
                        and the one in Fast & Furious, is the circle is not that closed, meaning they have the same angular velocity, but more tangential velocity because they radious is much larger.
