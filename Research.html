                  We live in an era that technology evolves faster than what we are able to comprehend. Probably an engineer would graduate know outdated knowledge, because once something new releases, before we learned how to master it, 
                  something new appered; and that's true to all aspects of technology, so it's physically impossible to know everything nowadays, you need to take into account we are bombarded with more information than the one we can process, 
                  and that's just for one area of expertise, now take into account everything that exists in the world. It was just in the 80’s when the new and revolutionary CD dropped out. It could store an astonishing amount of information 
                  for the time, you could fit entire movies, countless books, photo albums, and even AAA games in it, it stored about 500MB-1Gb, which today is basically nothing. In 1995 CD’s were replaced by USB, devices that were smaller and 
                  could carry more information, then micro-usb that can carry entire TERA-bytes, and so on, a smaller, faster and with more capacity of information device appeared. Regardless of the fact that this is hardly used anymore, adding 
                  to the fact that now the internet has become mainstream, no one needs to carry their information, the CD had a very interesting mechanism.
                  <br>
                   <br>
                The CD, just like the vinyl disk, has their information written in circles all over the disk. The disk had a small motor that spinned the disk with torque force, so that the needle could read the information. 
                The vinyl had its information written at ‘normal’ speed on the edges, and the closer it moved to the center, the information was engraved in ‘slow-motion’. Why did they do this? In circular motion, if there is 
                no acceleration, the angular velocity is always the same, but the closer to the center of the circle, in this case the disk, the tangential velocity is faster. The needle that read the information, was still in 
                a position, and moved closer to the center, but it only took or ‘read’ the tangential velocity, so the music they were hearing would always sound faster, each time it approached the center; this is why, to 
                compensate, they took more space to engrave the information, making it sound slower, but because the needle was closer to center, it should sound faster, combining this two, it just sounded normal.The downside 
                to this, is that you can’t fit a lot of information, because to compensate the velocity, and making it go slower to compensate the tangential velocity, they occupied each time the approached to the center more 
                space from the vinyl dik, and  the vinyl disk was huge, and still you could only fit one song, or two max, and for that you needed to flip the disk, and on that, the CD was different. The first difference is it 
                was read by a laser, so people could rewrite the information with ease, secondly they fit more information, because instead of making the information on the disk slower, they made it faster. They went from center 
                to the edge, making the whole process the other way around and way more efficient, in the two processes they had tangential acceleration, but there was a third method. Instead of modifying the tangential velocity, 
                having tangential acceleration, they made the velocity the same, and changed the angular velocity, they did this by changing speed of the motor spinning the disk, and in this way, they didn’t need to speed up or 
                slow down the velocity.

                <br>
                <p>The first vinyl was invented in 1948, and it played at a speed of 33 1/2 RPM, which is not bad, but compared to a CD that has an angular velocity of 500RPM, with a tangential speed of 1.2-1.4 m/s.</p>
